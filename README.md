# 📊 Database Systems Assignment – 93% Grade

Welcome! This repository contains the full submission of my university database systems assignment, which earned a **93%** mark. The code, SQL scripts, and documentation found here demonstrate my practical understanding of relational databases, normalization, querying, and backend logic integration. This project is part of my academic portfolio and is featured on my CV.

## 🏆 Highlights

- ✅ Achieved 93% overall
- 💡 Focused on relational schema design, normalization, and complex SQL queries
- 🛠️ Developed using MySQL / PostgreSQL (adapt based on your DBMS)
- 📁 Well-documented and cleanly structured for clarity

## 💼 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Java (OOP, JDBC, file handling)
- SQL (DDL, DML, joins, aggregation)

## 📌 Academic Context

This was a graded assignment for Further Object-Orientated Progamming at University of Kent , simulating a real-world data scenario. All code in the `Database Assignment` branch reflects the final, submitted version.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Connecting Java apps to SQL databases
